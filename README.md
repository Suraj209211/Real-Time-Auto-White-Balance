# Real-Time-Auto-White-Balance
The real-time auto white balance is coded in such a way that can be run in any kind of microprocessor. Deep learning approach will be the CNN that creates datasets for the experimental analysis of all the exposure values and that will result in the developement of the better exposure value.
